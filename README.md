# Radix Converter or Bitmask Calculator

This project serves a need for me personally as I frequently have to convert
binary numbers to hex, and back again, in the process of working with binary
protocols. And in the process, its not uncommon to apply some bitwise operations
which tends to be difficult to confirm by hand. Thus this tool was born!

The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive and all-in-one radix conversion tool
that allowed bitwise operations. The input parser understands some simple rules
or number formatting and the output box will attempt to output in the base which
is most _common_ in the input box.

Finally, this project served as my personal testbed for learning React. I have to
say, React made this project much simpler than I thought it would be. There is
much work to do to clean up the code and streamline, and all to clean up the
parser and calculator.
